  This project was initially maintained solely by me back in 2018 (that's nearly over 4 years ago!), but as time went on it became increasingly tedious to document the rapid changes in the VRChat ecosystem.
  
  
  And so I searched for help within the community and delegated the majority of work the [amazing contributors](https://github.com/orgs/vrchatapi/people) willing to spend time on the project to move it forward. Since then we've created an automated system to release SDKs in quite a few languages built upon the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification) we maintain.
